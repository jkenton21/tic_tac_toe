# tic_tac_toe

The purpose of this project it to build a simple tic-tac-toe game.

This game will allow two players to play tic-tac-toe against one another.

Player X and player O will take turns placing either an 'X' or an 'O' respectively on a 3 by 3 grid.
The winner of the game is whoever gets 3 markers in a row in any direction on the grid.
If neither player gets 3 in a row by the time every grid has been filled, the game ends in a tie.

The game web page will display the grids and allow the players to click on a grid cell to place their marker.
The web page will also display a message with the winner or if the game ended in a tie and allow the users to clear the board or restart the game.
